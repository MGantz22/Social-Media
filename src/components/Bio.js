    <p>I was born in 1971 in Pretoria, South Africa, oldest of three siblings. My father was a South African engineer, and my mother was a Canadian model and nutritionist.

    After my parents divorced in 1980, I lived primarily with my father. Now, I think my father is “a terrible human being...almost every evil thing you could possibly think of, he has done.”</p>
